# Solar-cell-Material-discovery
Setting up a machine-learning model that circumvents performing computaionally expensive dft calculations and accelerates the discovery for the optimal candidates for solar cell applications. The model enables us to predict property of interest bandgap for a perovskite oxide structures, by taking elements and their respective position in the lattices as input.
